## Server

### Create Default Playlist
If a Player cannot locate a schedule of media to be played, it will play the Default Playlist (DPL) in a loop to avoid dead air.
Using the `playlist` menu to create a new playlist: 

1. Provide a `Name` and `Description` for the (DPL).
1. From the media sidebar tab, __drag and drop__ selections to the DPL. As items are added to the list of Playlist Items, the `Total Duration` for all items on the Playlist is updated. Add items to the Playlist until the desired duration is achieved. See [Server Documentation](/server/#playlist) for more details on composing Playlists.

### Provision The Player

Using the `admin` menu to access the `player manager` options:

1. `Expand` existing Player Settings for a defined __Player__, or create a `New Player`.
1. Provide a `Name` and `Description` for the __Player__.
1. Enter the password that will be required for the __Player__ to establish a sync connection to the __Server__.
1. Set the media types that will be available for the __Player__. Ensure the __Player__ is configured properly to handle the assigned media types.
1. Set the `Timezone` that will be used for scheduling shows.
1. Drag the __Playlist__ created in the previous step (DPL) from the Playlist sidebar tab to the __Default Playlist__ landing zone (the area highlighted during the drag operation).
1. Save the Player.

## Player

### ### Sync the Player to Server

Access the [Player Dashboard](#dash) to set the device ID and password, and media sync connection details. Note that the intitial `show lock-in time` will require at least 20 minutes of lead time before playout of a scheduled or default playlist, thus ensuring all required media are downloaded before a show begins.
